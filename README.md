# Pagination & Content Filter
Second project potential realization for Full-Stack JS Developer Program. 

This version is made specialy for Treehouse students. My version lies in [repository](https://github.com/ermaxnet/threehouse-project-2.git). I just took my script from mentioned repisitory and connected it to a given task files. I havn't change any logics in this files. I hope the bureaucracy worth it...

*I took some styles for pagination and search field from my repository. Also the project uses a bit of ES6.*

### Have a nice examination! Max Eremin
